# Kohya Colabs

Accessible Google Colab notebooks for Stable Diffusion Lora training, based on the work of [kohya-ss and Linaqruf](https://github.com/Linaqruf/kohya-trainer)

If you need help or more details, I have written [a detailed guide here](https://civitai.com/models/22530).

If you're new to Stable Diffusion, [I have a guide for that too](https://huggingface.co/hollowstrawberry/stable-diffusion-guide/blob/main/README.md#index). Everything you need to know to get started.
